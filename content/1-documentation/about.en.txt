English is pre-registered and set as a default language, so you just need to add your other languages as a simple associative array.

```
c::set('languages', array(
  array(
    'code'    => 'en',
    ...
  ),
  array(
    'code'    => 'fr',
    'name'    => 'FR',
    'locale'  => 'fr_FR',
    'url'     => '/fr',
  )
));
```

#### Translate Theme Variables
Navigate into the `/sites/languages` folder and duplitate the file `en.php` and name it with the specific language shortcode.
Repeat for each available languages and edit the new files with you translations.


#### Translate your Content
You can now translate your content throught the Panel.

### Support Widget {#advanced-support-widget}
Displays a widget in the kirby panel's dashboard showing support options.
You can customize everything in this widget, it is particulary useful for web agencies who can show their support informations in their client's dashboards.

#### Options
All available options can be set in your config file in `/site/config` like this:
```
c::set('option', 'value');
```
| Option                     | Type    | Description
|----------------------------|---------|------------
| `aristotheme.widget`       | Boolean | Display the Aristotheme widget in the dashboard.
| `aristotheme.widget.title` | String  | The Widget Title
| `aristotheme.widget.links` | array() | The links to be displayed in the widget.
